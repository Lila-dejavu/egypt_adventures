# Copilot Instructions

## Overview
This document provides guidelines and instructions for using GitHub Copilot effectively in the `egypt_adventures` project.

## Key Features
- **Code Suggestions**: Copilot provides real-time code suggestions based on the context of your code.
- **Code Completion**: Automatically completes functions, methods, and other code structures.
- **Code Generation**: Generates boilerplate code, repetitive patterns, and even complex algorithms.

## How to Use
1. **Enable Copilot**: Ensure GitHub Copilot is enabled in your IDE.
2. **Write Descriptive Comments**: Use clear and descriptive comments to guide Copilot in generating relevant code.
3. **Review Suggestions**: Always review the suggestions provided by Copilot to ensure they align with your project requirements.
4. **Refine and Edit**: Modify the generated code as needed to fit the specific context of your project.

## Best Practices
- **Context is Key**: Provide as much context as possible in your code and comments to help Copilot generate accurate suggestions.
- **Iterative Development**: Use Copilot iteratively to refine your code incrementally.
- **Leverage Documentation**: Refer to project-specific documentation to ensure consistency with coding standards.

## Troubleshooting
- **Irrelevant Suggestions**: If Copilot provides irrelevant suggestions, try rephrasing your comments or providing more context.
- **Performance Issues**: Ensure your IDE and Copilot extension are updated to the latest versions.
- **Feedback**: Provide feedback on Copilot suggestions to help improve its accuracy over time.

## Project-Specific Notes
- **Game Logic**: When working on game logic (e.g., battle mechanics, event handling), ensure that the generated code aligns with the existing architecture.
- **UI Updates**: For UI-related changes, verify that the DOM manipulation is consistent with the structure defined in `DOMRefs.js`.
- **Localization**: Use the `i18n.js` file for any text displayed to the user to maintain consistency across languages.
